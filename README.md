Steps on how to create GitHub page:
    1. Create/pick your remote repository
    2. Clone the repository in your local machine
    3. Enter the project folder and add the index.html file
    4. Add, commit, and push any changes
    5. Go to Settings of your remote repository
    6. Go to Pages Section
    7. Select source branch to create the GitHub page

What are your key takeaways from this exercise?
    - HTML and CSS (or any UI) is tedious to code as we need to see the visual changes immediately and that takes a lot of time from the actual coding.
